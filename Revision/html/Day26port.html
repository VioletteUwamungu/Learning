				<h1>Introduction</h1><hr>
				<p>My name is Violette Uwamungu, and I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an uplifting experience. I am a keen person with a family of twelve. </p>
				<p> I enjoy reading, and the knowledge and perspective that my reading gives me has strengthened my learning and listening skills. I have been successful at raising a family, and I attribute this success to my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at once. This flexibility will help me in the classroom, where there are many different personalities and learning styles. Now, in 2018, I am working on my Associate of Arts projects through Colloge For America program.  ‚Äù</p>

				<h1>More Information</h1><hr>
				<p>Here are some of my experience about my learning process!</p>
				<p>My journey in Learning more about Computer Programming has left me with a sense of enlightenment. I am not saying that the journey ends! but I am half way openning my mind to learn more unfamiliar languages which I've found to be more interesting. Reaching here wasn't a long journey; instead, it was hard. Once you took a decision to do or work on something, you can make it. That how I tried at the extent I felt I can. I am still on my way, but I hope to reach where I want.</p>
