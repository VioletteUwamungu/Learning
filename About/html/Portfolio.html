	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
		My journey with the Learning Computer Program has left me with a sense of enlightenment. I am not saying that the journey ends! but I am half way openning my mind to learn more unfamiliar languages which I've found to be more interesting. <blockquote>At First, they will ask you why you are doing it. Later, they will ask you how you did it.</blockquote> It wasn't a long journey to reach here I am now; instead, it was hard. Once you took a decision to do or work on something, you can make it. That how I tried at the extent I felt I can. I am still on my way, but I hope to reach where I want.
