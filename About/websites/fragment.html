		Creating my own business will be a great achievement in my life. Nowadays, the unemployment level in my country is increasing day to day as the government is encouraging people not to wait for being employed or jobs from the governments, but recommending them to create their own businesses. Creating my own business is very important to me due to many of its advantages that I expect to get.  Firstly, it will be my source of income instead of waiting the money from my parents.
	</p>
	   <p> Therefore, I will be able to satisfy my basic needs and wants and support my family. Secondly, I will be independent. Being independent means not to depend on others or waiting to take instead of giving, this means that I will be a giver which successful people experience. In addition, developing my country will be my Motto as I will be able to participate in the development of my country.
